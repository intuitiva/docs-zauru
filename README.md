# zauru-docs

This Gatsby project is able to connect to your Contentful account.

## Quick Start

First, clone git repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:intuitiva/docs-zauru.git
```

This starter will try to talk to a Contentful Model named `tutorial`.

From your project's root, make sure dependencies are installed and start the Gatsby development server.

```bash
$ npm i
$ gatsby develop
```

## Production on Netlify

Push your site to Git and create a new site from that repo on Netlify. Make sure to add your Contentful creds in the environment variables.
